# Online/Offline Progressive Budget
This Progressive Budget app allows a user to be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. When entering transactions offline, they will populate the total when brought back online. Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Offline functionality is paramount to this application's success.

## Usage
[Here](https://intense-spire-96483.herokuapp.com/) is the link to the deployed app.  [Here](https://github.com/shaydaniel7/progressive-budget "Link to github repository") is the github repository for this project.

## Still to do
Need to utilize IndexedDB to add offline functionality. Review Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 4: Add Offline Persistence with IndexedDB.
