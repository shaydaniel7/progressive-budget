# Online/Offline Progressive Budget
This Progressive Budget app allows a user to be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. When entering transactions offline, they will populate the total when brought back online. Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Offline functionality is paramount to this application's success.

## Submission on BCS
* Deploy your application with [Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)
* You are required to submit the following:
  * the URL to the deployed application
  * the URL to the Github repository

## More Notes
Need to use IndexedDB to add offline functionality. Review Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 4: Add Offline Persistence with IndexedDB.
